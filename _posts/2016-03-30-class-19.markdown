## Project 2
We will be going over last minute items on Project 2.

We will be transitioning slowly over to Project 3. First, by talking about you, your work and preparing you to talk about and present your work in the best way possible.

## Your Work = You

I want you to spend the next week and weekend thinking about yourself and work. Think about the work you've created thus far and think about the work you want to do. Then, complete Assignment 4.
