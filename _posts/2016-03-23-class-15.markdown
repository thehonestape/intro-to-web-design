Project 2 Workshop: Keep working on project 2

---

# **New Project 2 Due Date**
I know a lot of people have been working hard to get this project done but need more one on one time/class time to finish. So, I'm giving you all one more week to finish Project 2. I expect everyone to take full advantage of the extra studio time to create something awesome. See [Project 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EuLvqW09PbJPvGQUxp2m-hIiOo2HMpGw-B14o7rj-gY/edit?usp=sharing) docs for any other information.
