Turning in Project 2  
This depends on your webhost, but these are the general instructions. If you have questions about this, please ask them sooner rather than later.

1. Login to your webhost  
2. Create a new subdomain (yourprojectname.yourwebsitename.com)  
3. Connect to your server via FTP  
4. Put your files on the server inside of the subdomain (all files, not just the folder)   
5. Make sure things are working correctly
6. Post your link in Slack #projects channel
