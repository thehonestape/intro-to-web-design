**Set Up Your Website**  
We ran out of time last week, so this will be the first thing we do in class  

1. Buy a domain. This can be done several ways. Let's talk about it in class. (if you already have one, follow the next steps)
2. Set up your host. I'm familiar with [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com). It is very cheap and should suffice for this class.  
3. Set up a subdomain for this class. Titled "learning"[Instructions](https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/help/274)  
4 Connect via FTP. https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/help/264  
5. Find your subdomain folder titled "learning"  
6. Create a folder called exercises  
7. Create a folder called ex3  
8. Put all of the files for exercise 3 in that folder.  
9. Submit your working link to Slack.

>I'm fairly positive I'm missing some steps here. Let's figure it out in class.

Other host options:  
I know at least one of you asked about other options other than Bluehost. The highest end shared hosting service I could find was [Media Temple](https://mediatemple.net/webhosting/shared/). I have used them in the past, they do have great customer support but are definitely more pricey than Bluehost.

Development Exercise Due on Monday, February 8
-----

**Outline**  
The goal of this exercise is to help you learn to  

* Link a CSS style to an HTML document  
* Understand the relationship between CSS rules and HTML elements  
* Understand CSS classes  
* Be able to change CSS properties  


**Style**  

* Make a copy of your “ex3” folder, which contains your HTML recipe and image. Rename it “ex4”.  
* Create a new folder inside “ex4” called “css”. This is where you will put your external CSS file.  
* Create an external CSS file, link it to the HTML file, and use it to style your page. It must meet the requirements below at minimum, though additional exploration is encouraged.  
* All style must be done in CSS and NOT in the HTML — this includes colors, backgrounds, alignment, and centering.  


**Requirements**
1. Restyle all text on the page in some fashion. You should aim for coherence in your font and color selection. Be sure to use only the suggested web fonts (Arial, Verdana, Georgia, etc.).  
2. Restyle the nutrition facts table by adding background colors and other properties as seen on pages Ducket
337-340.  
3. Restyle the lists using properties seen on pages 333-336.  
4. Find a background image from subtlepatterns.com and use it on the whole page.  
5. Restyle all four states of the link to the original recipe on food.com (link, visited, hover, and active).  
6. Add a border to the image.  
7. You must use at least one class and one ID, though you will likely need more.  

**Submit**  
Upload to a folder called ex4" on your site. The URL should function everywhere at
www.learning.yourdomain.com/exercises/ex4/  

Once your link works, post it in Slack in #exercises
